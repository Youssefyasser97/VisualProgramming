# VisualProgramming
Website for simplified database operations (Create, update, etc..) that is visually simple for people with no coding background


This project aims to get students or people with zero or little background on coding and databases familiar with database operations. It simplifies the syntax and visualizes the results so that the user understands what each operation does.

To run the website:
1. Install/run Xampp
2. Locate the files in folder "C:/Xampp/htdocs/vp2" (Not necassarily C, could be any location where Xampp is installed)
3. Open Xampp and Start Apache and MySQL servers
4. Open any browser and type in URL "localhost/phpmyadmin"
5. Create the database where all your operations would take place at (By clicking new and naming it preferably "yussef" to avoid modifications in code)
6. Now go to URL "localhost/vp"

And start your database manipulation operations.
